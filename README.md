# Text Indexing WS 2024/25

My C implementation of the assignment for text indexing course for the
WS 2024/25. In brief, the task is to implement three trie variants.

## Development

`gcc` with a suitable version (in my case `13.3.1 20240614`) is
required. `make` is a handy addon to handle the compilation. The C
standard library is the only dependency.

To build the executable, run `make` in the project directory. The
executable `ti_program` is created and can be used as described by the
task. Run `make test` to run the test suite. `ti_programm` by itself
prints the help message:

```txt
Usage: ti_programm [-du] INPUT_FILE QUERY_FILE

The main entry point for the text indexing exercise 2024/25.

options:
-t   TASK_MODE,  displays the execution status of each word in the query. One status per line. DEFAULT
-d   DOT_MODE,   displays the generated trie in a DOT readable format.
-u   DUMP_MODE,  dumps the trie one word per line.
```

Note that some nice-to-have features are added and can be opted in via
the cli arguments.

### Tools

Some common tools are found under `tools`. They aim to support the
development process.

### Sqlplot-tools

The [`sqlplot-tools`](https://github.com/bingmann/sqlplot-tools/) can
be used to generate performance plots. Run `make sqlplot-tools` to
initialize the submodule and compile the tools. Make sure that the
required dependencies by sqlplot-tools are installed.

## ToDo

- [x] üå≤ Implement the general trie traversal routines
  - [x] Insert
  - [x] Contains
  - [x] Delete
- [x] üìã Implement the fixed sized array version
  - [x] Insert
  - [x] Contains
  - [x] Delete
- [ ] üìè Implement the variable sized array version
  - [ ] Insert
  - [ ] Contains
  - [ ] Delete
- [ ] üóÉÔ∏è  Implement the hash table version
  - [ ] Insert
  - [ ] Contains
  - [ ] Delete
- [x] Add the code to handle the cli
- [x] Add the contruction from input file routine
- [x] Add the queries from input file routine
- [ ] Format the output according to the task
- [ ] Add a suitable test suite
- [ ] Controll if the query null terminator before the action is
      prefixed with a space
- [x] Implement a cleanup (free) function

## Questions

- [ ] Is there a space before the null terminator in the `query.txt`?
- [ ] Ask for an example `creation` and `query` file.
- [ ] Ask about the inconsistencies in the task file.
- [ ] Ask about the setup the tests will be run on (SIMD, RAM).
- [ ] Ask about the input files (i.e. distribution of characters, size).
